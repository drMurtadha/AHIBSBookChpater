# Participant Notes — Session 2: AI-Assisted Drafting Pipeline (NotebookLM)  
**Time:** 10:45 AM – 12:15 PM (90 minutes)  
**Outcome:** Set up a NotebookLM drafting pipeline and produce draft text for the first 2–3 chapter sections.

## 1) Session Objectives  
By the end of this session, you should be able to:  
- Set up a dedicated NotebookLM notebook with all relevant sources (guidelines, templates, your research, chapter plan).  
- Use NotebookLM ethically and effectively as a structured drafting assistant.  
- Generate, expand, and refine draft sections while maintaining authorship and academic integrity.  
- Apply a repeatable pipeline to produce a substantial first draft (target: ≥70% of target word count by end of workshop).

## 3) Key Content and Takeaways  

### Part 1 — Why NotebookLM? Overview and Ethical Guidelines  
**Why NotebookLM for academic drafting**  
- Works from your uploaded sources, reduces unsupported content outside your materials.  
- Strong for synthesis, expansion, and structuring aligned with guidelines and your research.  
- Useful features may include chat querying and structured outputs like briefing documents, study guides, timelines, and audio summaries.

**Integrity and ethics rules**  
- Treat AI as an assistant, not an author.  
- Verify facts, claims, and references.  
- Maintain traceability: keep track of prompts and outputs, then rewrite in your own voice.  
- Avoid copying large chunks without substantial rewriting.  
- Follow publisher and institutional disclosure expectations where applicable.

### Part 2 — Setting up Your NotebookLM Pipeline (Live Demo)  
**Step 1: Create a NotebookLM project**  
- Go to `notebooklm.google.com`  
- Create **New Notebook**  
- Title example: `Edited Book Chapter Draft – [Your Name/Topic]`

**Step 2: Upload shared sources (submission kit)**  
- Submission kit PDFs (e.g., criteria documents, guidelines, templates).  
- Publisher webpages or downloaded PDFs if relevant.  
- Any workshop shared materials (slides, workflow PDFs).

**Step 3: Add your personal sources**  
- Your papers (journal and conference), thesis chapters, datasets summaries.  
- Your chapter plan from Session 1 (paste as text or upload as a doc).  
- Additional references as needed (keep it focused).

**Step 4: Prime the notebook (starter queries)**  
- “Summarise the key formatting and submission requirements from the guidelines I uploaded.”  
- “Create a briefing document combining my chapter outline with the publisher’s recommended structure.”  
- Optional: generate an audio overview for quick review.

**Recommended workflow pipeline**  
1. Upload sources  
2. Prime with guidelines  
3. Query section-by-section  
4. Export draft text to Word or Google Docs  
5. Rewrite extensively in your own voice  
6. Add and verify citations properly

## 4) Hands-on Drafting (What You Do Today)  
**Focus today:** first 2–3 sections (e.g., Introduction, Background or Literature Review, Methodology or Core Content).

### Step-by-step  
1. Draft one section at a time.  
2. Generate text in NotebookLM.  
3. Copy to a separate document.  
4. Rewrite heavily and add citations.  
5. Track word count progress and save strong outputs.

### Copy-paste prompts (edit brackets before use)

   **Prompt 1 – Expand a section**
   ```
   Using my chapter outline and uploaded research papers, generate a detailed draft (800–1000 words) for the Introduction section. Include: context, problem statement, research gap, objectives, and chapter overview. Follow UTM Press formatting guidelines. Write in academic tone, third person, and suggest places for citations from my sources.
   ```

   **Prompt 2 – Literature synthesis**
   ```
   Synthesise the key findings from my uploaded papers [list paper titles]. Identify gaps and suggest how this chapter addresses them. Output as a draft Literature Review section (1000 words) with suggested citation placeholders.
   ```

   **Prompt 3 – Practical implications / case studies**
   ```
   Based on my research and the book theme, propose 2–3 practical implications or case studies to include in the Discussion section. Provide draft text (600 words) with examples grounded only in my uploaded sources.
   ```

   **Prompt 4 – Ensure compliance**
   ```
   Review the draft text I paste below against UTM Press guidelines. Highlight any formatting, style, or content issues and suggest fixes.
