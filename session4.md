## Detailed Content & Talking Points

### Part 1: Key Editing Priorities for Edited Book Chapters (15 min)
- **Why dedicated editing matters**
  - First impressions for editors/reviewers.
  - Compliance with UTM Press guidelines (formatting, referencing style, language).
  - Ensures consistency across the book (especially important in edited volumes).
- **Core editing areas**
  - Formatting: Headings, fonts, spacing, figures/tables (per GUIDELINE E-PRESS.pdf).
  - Language & style: Clarity, conciseness, academic tone, active/passive balance.
  - Consistency: Terminology, abbreviations, tense, spelling (British/Malaysian English).
  - Referencing: Correct style (APA/Vancouver as specified), completeness.
  - Overall polish: Eliminate repetition, improve sentence variety, strengthen conclusions.
- **UTM Press-specific reminders**
  - Refer to uploaded guidelines: 10 KRITERIA, GARIS-PANDUAN, typesetting instructions.
  - Common rejection reasons: Poor formatting, inconsistent style, language errors.

### Part 2: NotebookLM as an Advanced Editor (10 min)
**Live Demo** (use updated notebook with full draft sections uploaded)

1. **Prepare the notebook**
   - Ensure latest draft versions are uploaded/updated.
   - All publisher guidelines remain loaded for reference.

2. **NotebookLM editing features**
   - Precise queries for line-by-line suggestions.
   - Consistency checks across the entire draft.
   - Style and formatting compliance reviews.

**Sample Prompts** (demonstrate 4–5 live)

   **Prompt 1 – Full draft compliance check**
   ```
   Act as a professional copyeditor familiar with UTM Press guidelines. Review my entire uploaded chapter draft and:
   1. Check adherence to formatting rules (headings, spacing, fonts, etc.).
   2. Flag any inconsistencies in terminology, abbreviations, or referencing style.
   3. Suggest specific fixes with examples.
   Output in a structured list.
   ```

   **Prompt 2 – Language polishing**
   ```
   Review my draft for clarity, conciseness, and academic tone. Identify 5–7 sentences or paragraphs that are wordy, repetitive, or unclear. Provide concise rewritten versions in scholarly Malaysian/British English, preserving my original meaning and voice.
   ```

   **Prompt 3 – Consistency across sections**
   ```
   Analyse my draft for consistency in terminology (e.g., "artificial intelligence" vs "AI"), tense usage, and abbreviation introduction. List all inconsistencies found and suggest standardised forms based on academic best practices.
   ```

   **Prompt 4 – Referencing and citation polish**
   ```
   Check my draft for referencing issues: missing citations, incomplete references, or incorrect formatting. Suggest specific additions or corrections using sources from my uploaded research papers. Also recommend places to strengthen claims with additional evidence.
   ```

   **Prompt 5 – Final readability enhancements**
   ```
   Suggest improvements to sentence variety and flow in [specific section]. Provide 4–5 revised example paragraphs that enhance readability while maintaining formal academic tone.
   ```

### Part 3: Hands-on Editing (7 min)
Participants work individually (short but focused).

**Step-by-step instructions** (display on slide)

1. Update NotebookLM with your current full/near-full draft.
2. Run at least 3 prompts from the samples above (focus on compliance, language, and consistency).
3. Implement suggestions manually in your Word/Google Docs draft:
   - Make formatting adjustments.
   - Rewrite flagged sections.
   - Fix references and consistency issues.
4. Track word count – aim to maintain or slightly reduce for conciseness.

**Goal for this session**: A noticeably cleaner, publisher-compliant draft ready for final sprint additions.

### Quick Shares & Transition (3 min)
- Ask 1–2 volunteers to share one “before/after” edit example.
- Celebrate: “Your chapters are now looking professional and submission-ready.”
- Transition: “After break, we’ll do a guided writing sprint to push toward ≥70% completion using the same NotebookLM pipeline.”
