# Participant Notes — Session 5: Guided Writing Sprint (≥70% Draft)  
**Time:** 3:30 PM – 4:15 PM (45 minutes)  
**Outcome:** Use the full NotebookLM pipeline to push your chapter draft to at least 70% of target word count.

---

## 1) Session Objectives  
By the end of this session, you should be able to:  
- Apply the NotebookLM pipeline to generate, expand, and integrate remaining sections efficiently.  
- Produce a draft reaching ≥70% of target word count (often 4,200–7,000 words for a 6,000–10,000 word chapter).  
- Overcome writing blocks using iterative prompts while maintaining integrity and personal voice.  
- End with a coherent draft ready for final revisions after the workshop.

## 2) Session Flow  
| Time | Activity | What you should do |
|---|---|---|
| 3:30–3:35 (5 min) | Progress recap, sprint goals | Report current word count, confirm target for this sprint. |
| 3:35–3:40 (5 min) | Part 1: Sprint strategy and prioritisation | Identify your biggest gaps and highest impact sections. |
| 3:40–3:50 (10 min) | Part 2: Guided generation of high-impact sections (live demo) | Watch the prompts, note how to adapt them to your chapter. |
| 3:50–4:10 (20 min) | Part 3: Independent sprint using NotebookLM | Generate, rewrite, integrate, update word count. |
| 4:10–4:15 (5 min) | Final progress check and celebration | Share progress and next steps. |

## 3) Sprint Strategy and Prioritisation  
### Current state check  
Most participants should already have:  
- A chapter plan (title, abstract, outline).  
- Introductory sections.  
- Literature or background.  
- Some core content.

Typical gaps include:  
- Methodology or technical details.  
- Results or core analysis.  
- Discussion and implications.  
- Conclusion.  
- References and citation completion.

### Sprint priorities  
- Start with high word count sections first, usually core analysis and discussion.  
- Optimise for momentum: generate raw text quickly, then lightly edit and integrate.  
- Target ≥70% completion, raw word count is acceptable, polish comes later.

### Integrity rules for the sprint  
- Generate using NotebookLM.  
- Read carefully and verify alignment with your sources.  
- Rewrite extensively in your own voice.  
- Integrate into the master draft with coherent transitions.

## 4) Guided Prompts for High-Impact Generation  
Edit bracketed items before use.

**Prompt 1 — Core content expansion**  
```text
Using my uploaded research papers, chapter outline, and existing draft sections, generate a detailed draft (1500–2000 words) for the [Core Analysis/Methodology/Results] section. Build directly on what I have already written. Include critical analysis, evidence from sources, and clear structure with subheadings. Suggest citation placeholders.
```
   **Prompt 2 – Discussion and implications**
   ```
   Draft a comprehensive Discussion section (1000–1500 words) that synthesises findings from my research, addresses the chapter objectives, highlights implications (theoretical/practical/policy), and identifies limitations/future work. Ground everything in my uploaded sources and align with the book theme.
   ```

   **Prompt 3 – Conclusion and strong close**
   ```
   Write a concise yet impactful Conclusion (500–800 words) that restates key contributions, reinforces significance, and ends with forward-looking statements. Ensure smooth transition from the Discussion section in my draft.
   ```

   **Prompt 4 – Rapid gap-filling**
   ```
   Review my current full draft and chapter outline. Identify the 2–3 sections with the largest word count gaps. For the biggest gap ([specify section]), generate 800–1200 words of additional content with depth and evidence from my sources.
   ```

   **Bonus iteration prompt**
   ```
   Take the new text I generated [paste here] and integrate it smoothly into my existing draft. Suggest improved transitions and resolve any overlaps or contradictions.
   ```

## 5) Independent Sprint (What You Do Now)

Step-by-step
1.	Check your current word count and estimate percent completion.
2.	Choose focus sections: prioritise the largest gaps and highest impact sections.
3.	Run 2–4 targeted prompts to generate content for those sections.
4.	Sprint workflow:
- Copy output into a separate document.
- Rewrite extensively, add your expert framing and any missing nuance.
- Paste revised text into your master draft.
- If time allows, re-upload updated sections into NotebookLM for continuity.
5.	If stuck:
- Use the rapid gap-filling prompt.
- Ask for support to refine prompts or interpret outputs.

Target output for this session
- Add 2,000+ words of revised content and reach ≥70% draft completion.


## 6) Final Progress Check and Wrap

If invited, share:
-	Current word count and estimated completion percent.
-	One sentence on what improved most during the sprint.

Key reminder:
- The draft is yours, NotebookLM accelerates the process, your expertise provides the substance and integrity.
