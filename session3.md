# Session 3: Strengthening Academic Quality  
*(1:15 PM – 2:30 PM, ~75 minutes)*

## Session Objectives
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

1. Use NotebookLM to critically evaluate and strengthen the academic rigor of their draft chapters.
2. Identify and address common weaknesses in structure, argumentation, originality, and referencing using targeted NotebookLM prompts.
3. Enhance coherence, flow, and scholarly depth while preserving their own authorial voice.
4. Produce a significantly improved version of their existing draft sections with greater academic integrity and quality.

## Detailed Content & Talking Points

### Part 1: Key Elements of Academic Quality (15 min)
- **Core pillars of strong academic chapters**
  - Clear argumentation and logical flow.
  - Robust evidence, accurate claims, and proper referencing.
  - Original contributions (synthesis, insights, implications beyond existing work).
  - Coherence and readability (transitions, signposting, consistent terminology).
  - Alignment with publisher guidelines (e.g., UTM Press criteria on originality, contribution, and structure).
- **Common issues in AI-assisted drafts**
  - Over-reliance on generic phrasing.
  - Weak transitions or repetitive structures.
  - Insufficient critical analysis or depth.
  - Missing or placeholder citations.
- **Goal today**: Transform raw drafts into scholarly prose using NotebookLM as a critical reviewer.

### Part 2: Using NotebookLM for Critical Self-Review (15 min)
**Live Demo** (use your notebook with sample draft sections uploaded)

1. **Re-upload/update your notebook**
   - Add your current draft sections (from Session 2) as new sources (Google Docs or pasted text).
   - This allows NotebookLM to reference both original research/guidelines AND your evolving draft.

2. **Key NotebookLM features for quality enhancement**
   - Chat for targeted critique.
   - Generate suggested revisions.
   - Briefing Doc or Study Guide for overall summary of strengths/weaknesses.

**Sample Prompts** (demonstrate 3–4 live)

   **Prompt 1 – Overall critique**
   ```
   Act as an experienced academic peer reviewer. Review my uploaded draft sections against high-quality academic standards and UTM Press guidelines. Provide:
   1. Strengths (2–3 points)
   2. Major weaknesses (with specific examples)
   3. Suggested improvements for argumentation, originality, and flow.
   Do not rewrite the entire text — focus on feedback.
   ```

   **Prompt 2 – Strengthen argumentation**
   ```
   For the [specific section, e.g., Literature Review] in my draft, suggest ways to deepen critical analysis. Identify where claims are underdeveloped and propose 3–4 specific additions (e.g., counterarguments, comparisons, or implications) grounded in my uploaded research sources. Output as bullet-point recommendations with example sentences I can adapt.
   ```

   **Prompt 3 – Improve coherence and flow**
   ```
   Analyse transitions and logical flow in my draft. Suggest improved topic sentences and linking phrases for better coherence between paragraphs/sections. Provide revised versions of 4–5 weak transitions from my text.
   ```

   **Prompt 4 – Referencing and originality check**
   ```
   Review my draft for places needing citations. Suggest specific references from my uploaded research papers to support claims. Also flag any overly generic phrasing that reduces originality and suggest more precise, scholarly alternatives.
   ```

   **Prompt 5 – Generate enhanced version of a paragraph**
   ```
   Take this paragraph from my draft [paste paragraph]. Rewrite it to enhance academic depth, criticality, and voice while staying faithful to my original meaning. Use evidence from my sources and improve scholarly tone.
   ```

### Part 3: Hands-on Strengthening (25 min)
Participants work individually.

**Step-by-step instructions** (display on slide)

1. Update your NotebookLM notebook:
   - Upload/re-upload your latest draft sections.
2. Run 3–5 targeted prompts from the samples above on different parts of your draft.
3. For each output:
   - Read suggestions carefully.
   - Manually revise your draft in Word/Google Docs (rewrite extensively).
   - Aim to improve at least 2–3 sections significantly.
4. Track changes: Note what NotebookLM suggested and how you implemented it.

**Goal for this session**: Revised draft with noticeably stronger argumentation, flow, and referencing (~1000–2000 words improved).

**Support**: Roam to help with prompt crafting or interpreting outputs.

### Part 4: Quick Shares & Transition (10 min)
- Invite 2–3 volunteers to share:
  - One "before" paragraph.
  - NotebookLM suggestion.
  - Their "after" revised version.
- Highlight common wins: Deeper analysis, better transitions, stronger voice.
- Remind: “NotebookLM is your rigorous peer reviewer — use it to elevate quality without losing authorship.”
- Transition: “Next, we’ll shift to final editing for publication-ready polish.”

## Slides Recommendation (9–11 slides max)
