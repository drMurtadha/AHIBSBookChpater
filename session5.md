# Session 5: Guided Writing Sprint (≥70% Draft)  
*(3:30 PM – 4:15 PM, ~45 minutes)*

## Session Objectives
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

1. Apply the full NotebookLM pipeline to generate, expand, and integrate remaining chapter sections efficiently.
2. Produce a substantial draft reaching at least 70% of the target word count (typically 4,200–7,000 words for a 6,000–10,000 word chapter).
3. Overcome writing blocks using targeted, iterative NotebookLM prompts while maintaining academic integrity and personal voice.
4. End the day with a complete, coherent draft ready for final revisions post-workshop.

## Detailed Content & Talking Points

### Part 1: Sprint Strategy and Prioritisation (5 min)
- **Current state check**
  - Most participants should have: Chapter plan, introductory sections, literature/background, some core content.
  - Typical gap: Methodology/details, discussion, implications, conclusion, references.
- **Sprint priorities**
  - Focus on high-word-count sections first (core analysis/discussion).
  - Aim for momentum: Generate raw text quickly, then lightly edit.
  - Target: ≥70% complete (raw word count OK – polishing comes later).
- **Mindset reminders**
  - This is a sprint – perfection later.
  - NotebookLM excels at rapid expansion grounded in your sources.
  - Ethical rule: Generate → Read → Rewrite extensively → Integrate.

### Part 2: Guided Generation of High-Impact Sections (10 min)
**Live Demo** (use your notebook with updated full draft)

1. **Ensure notebook is current**
   - Latest draft sections uploaded.
   - Chapter outline and all research/guidelines still loaded.

2. **Strategic sprint prompts** (demonstrate 4 key prompts live)

   **Prompt 1 – Core content expansion**
   ```
   Using my uploaded research papers, chapter outline, and existing draft sections, generate a detailed draft (1500–2000 words) for the [Core Analysis/Methodology/Results] section. Build directly on what I have already written. Include critical analysis, evidence from sources, and clear structure with subheadings. Suggest citation placeholders.
   ```

   **Prompt 2 – Discussion and implications**
   ```
   Draft a comprehensive Discussion section (1000–1500 words) that synthesises findings from my research, addresses the chapter objectives, highlights implications (theoretical/practical/policy), and identifies limitations/future work. Ground everything in my uploaded sources and align with the book theme.
   ```

   **Prompt 3 – Conclusion and strong close**
   ```
   Write a concise yet impactful Conclusion (500–800 words) that restates key contributions, reinforces significance, and ends with forward-looking statements. Ensure smooth transition from the Discussion section in my draft.
   ```

   **Prompt 4 – Rapid gap-filling**
   ```
   Review my current full draft and chapter outline. Identify the 2–3 sections with the largest word count gaps. For the biggest gap ([specify section]), generate 800–1200 words of additional content with depth and evidence from my sources.
   ```

   **Bonus iteration prompt**
   ```
   Take the new text I generated [paste here] and integrate it smoothly into my existing draft. Suggest improved transitions and resolve any overlaps or contradictions.
   ```

### Part 3: Independent Writing Sprint (20 min)
Participants work intensively.

**Step-by-step instructions** (display on slide)

1. Check your current word count (quick share if needed).
2. Decide your focus:
   - Prioritise largest remaining sections.
   - Use the demonstrated prompts (adapt section names/word targets).
3. Sprint workflow:
   - Run 2–4 targeted generation prompts.
   - Copy output → Separate doc → Rewrite extensively (change wording, add your insights).
   - Paste revised text into master draft.
   - Re-upload updated sections to NotebookLM for continuity if time allows.
4. If stuck:
   - Use the gap-filling prompt.
   - Ask for help (roaming support).

**Goal**: Add 2,000+ words of revised content → Reach ≥70% total draft completion.

**Support**: Active roaming – help craft prompts, interpret outputs, overcome blocks.

### Final Progress Check & Celebration (5 min)
- Quick go-around: “Current word count? % complete? One sentence on how it feels.”
- Celebrate achievements: “Many of you started today with ideas – you’re leaving with substantial chapters!”
- Reminder: “This draft is yours. NotebookLM accelerated it, but your expertise shaped it.”
- Transition: “In wrap-up, we’ll discuss next steps: final revisions, submission, and ongoing support.”
