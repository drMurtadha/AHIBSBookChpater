# Session 1: From Research to Chapter Plan  
*(9:45 AM – 10:30 AM, ~45 minutes)*

## Session Objectives
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

1. Explain the role and value of an edited book chapter in an academic career.
2. Identify which of their existing research outputs or ideas are suitable for adaptation into a chapter.
3. Develop a clear chapter plan consisting of a working title, abstract, and detailed outline.
4. Use AI tools effectively (and ethically) to accelerate the planning process.

## Detailed Content & Talking Points

### Part 1: What Makes a Good Edited Book Chapter? (10 min)
- **Key differences from journal articles**
  - Broader scope, more narrative freedom, opportunity for synthesis/review.
  - Often allows deeper conceptual discussion, case studies, or future directions.
  - Length typically 6,000–10,000 words (check specific call guidelines).
  - Audience: academics, practitioners, postgraduate students — write accessibly.
- **Value in Malaysian academic context**
  - Counts toward publication incentives (e.g., RADIS evidence, MyRA, promotion criteria).
  - Faster publication timeline than many journals.
  - Builds visibility and networks with editors/other contributors.
- **Common pitfalls to avoid**
  - Repurposing a journal article verbatim (editors reject duplication).
  - Too narrow/technical or too broad/vague.

### Part 2: Selecting & Scoping Research for a Chapter (10 min)
- **Inventory your research assets**
  - Published papers, conference papers, theses, datasets, ongoing projects, literature reviews you’ve done.
  - Ideas that didn’t fit into a journal article but deserve deeper exploration.
- **Suitability checklist**
  - Does it fit the book’s theme/call for chapters?
  - Can it be expanded with synthesis, new insights, or practical implications?
  - Is there enough material for 6,000+ words without padding?
  - Do you have 2–3 months to write and revise?
- **Examples** (prepare 2–3 quick real or anonymised examples)
  - Example 1: A conference paper on “AI in education” → expanded into a chapter with case studies and policy recommendations.
  - Example 2: Literature review from a grant proposal → turned into a state-of-the-art chapter.

### Part 3: Building the Chapter Plan (10 min)
**Three core deliverables** (this becomes the proposal most edited books require):

1. **Title**
   - Informative + engaging.
   - Good: “Leveraging Large Language Models for Automated Code Review: Opportunities and Ethical Challenges”
   - Avoid: “Study on LLMs”
2. **Abstract** (200–300 words)
   - Structure: Context → Problem/Gap → Objective → Approach/Contribution → Significance.
3. **Detailed Outline**
   - Major sections (Introduction, Background, Methodology/Approach, Findings/Discussion, Conclusion, Future Work).
   - Subsections with 1–2 sentence descriptions.
   - Indicate approximate word count per section.

**Live AI Demo** (use Grok/ChatGPT/Claude — whichever you prefer)
- Prompt example to demonstrate live:

```
I have a published paper on [brief summary of participant’s research area]. The edited book theme is [book theme]. Help me create: 
(1) a compelling chapter title, 
(2) a 250-word abstract, and 
(3) a detailed outline with 6–8 main sections. 
Ensure the chapter extends the original paper with new insights and practical implications. Maintain full academic integrity — I will write all content myself.
```

- Show how to refine the output (iterative prompting).

### Hands-on Activity (8 min)
Participants open their laptop/phone and:

1. Choose one piece of their research.
2. Write a short 2–3 sentence summary of it.
3. Paste into an AI tool with a version of the prompt above.
4. Generate and lightly edit their title, abstract, and outline.

Encourage them to save the output — they will refine it further in later sessions.

### Closing & Transition (2 min)
- Ask for one quick volunteer share (title only).
- Remind: “This plan is your roadmap. AI helped generate ideas fast, but you remain the author.”
- Transition: “After break, we’ll move from plan to actual drafting pipeline using LM notebooks.”
