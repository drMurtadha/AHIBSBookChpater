# Session 2: AI-Assisted Drafting Pipeline (NotebookLM)  
*(10:45 AM – 12:15 PM, ~90 minutes)*

## Session Objectives
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

1. Set up a Dedicated NotebookLM notebook with all relevant sources (submission guidelines, templates, personal research materials, and chapter plan).
2. Use NotebookLM ethically and effectively as a structured drafting assistant.
3. Generate, expand, and refine draft sections of their chapter while maintaining full authorship and academic integrity.
4. Establish a repeatable pipeline for producing a substantial first draft (aiming for ≥70% of target word count by end of workshop).

## Detailed Content & Talking Points

### Part 1: Why NotebookLM? Overview & Ethical Guidelines (15 min)
- **Why NotebookLM for academic drafting?**
  - Grounded in your sources only – no hallucinations outside uploaded materials.
  - Excellent for synthesis, expansion, and structuring based on guidelines + your research.
  - Generates ideas, outlines, and draft text grounded in your uploads.
  - Features: Chat query, Audio Overview (great for reviewing), Study Guide, Timeline, Briefing Doc.
- **Ethical reminders** (tie back to workshop integrity rules)
  - AI is a writing assistant, NOT an author.
  - Always verify facts, claims, and citations.
  - Keep traceability: note which prompts generated which text, then heavily rewrite in your voice.
  - Do NOT copy-paste large chunks without substantial editing.
  - Declaration: Many publishers (including UTM Press) require disclosure of AI, AI use – NotebookLM is low-risk when used transparently.

### Part 2: Setting up Your NotebookLM Pipeline (20 min)
**Live Demo Steps** (show your pre-prepared notebook)

1. **Create the NotebookLM project**
   - Go to notebooklm.google.com → New Notebook → Title: “Edited Book Chapter Draft – [Your Name/Topic]”

2. **Upload core shared sources** (you have pre-uploaded these for participants to copy or you share the notebook link if possible)
   - All files from the Submission Kit (PDFs: 10 KRITERIA, GARIS-PANDUAN, GUIDELINE E-PRESS, etc.)
   - UTM Press relevant URLs (as webpages or PDFs if downloaded)
     - Example URLs to add: UTM Press book chapter guidelines page, formatting templates, etc.
   - Proses kerja.pdf, Slide materials, etc.

3. **Participants add personal sources**
   - Their own research papers/PDFs (published articles, theses, data summaries)
   - Chapter plan from Session 1 (copy-paste as text source or Google Doc)
   - Any additional references (up to 50 sources max recommended)

4. **Initial queries to prime the notebook**
   - “Summarise the key formatting and submission requirements from the UTM Press guidelines.”
   - “Create a briefing doc combining my chapter outline with the publisher’s recommended structure.”
   - Generate an Audio Overview of all sources (play a short clip – great for quick review).

**Recommended Pipeline Workflow** (show as a simple flowchart on slide)
1. Upload → 2. Prime with guidelines → 3. Query section-by-section → 4. Copy to Word/Google Docs → 5. Heavily edit/rewrite → 6. Cite properly.

### Part 3: Hands-on Drafting (30 min)
Participants work individually on their laptops.

**Step-by-step instructions** (display on slide + handout)

1. **Section-by-section drafting** (focus on first 2–3 sections today)
   - Start with Introduction → Background/Literature → Methodology or Core Content.

2. **Sample prompts** (provide these exact prompts – participants copy-paste and adapt)

   **Prompt 1 – Expand a section**
   ```
   Using my chapter outline and uploaded research papers, generate a detailed draft (800–1000 words) for the Introduction section. Include: context, problem statement, research gap, objectives, and chapter overview. Follow UTM Press formatting guidelines. Write in academic tone, third person, and suggest places for citations from my sources.
   ```

   **Prompt 2 – Literature synthesis**
   ```
   Synthesise the key findings from my uploaded papers [list paper titles]. Identify gaps and suggest how this chapter addresses them. Output as a draft Literature Review section (1000 words) with suggested citation placeholders.
   ```

   **Prompt 3 – Practical implications / case studies**
   ```
   Based on my research and the book theme, propose 2–3 practical implications or case studies to include in the Discussion section. Provide draft text (600 words) with examples grounded only in my uploaded sources.
   ```

   **Prompt 4 – Ensure compliance**
   ```
   Review the draft text I paste below against UTM Press guidelines. Highlight any formatting, style, or content issues and suggest fixes.
   [Paste your generated text here]
   ```

3. **Workflow tips**
   - Generate → Copy to separate doc → Rewrite extensively (aim: change ≥70% of wording).
   - Track word count progress.
   - Use “Saved Responses” in NotebookLM to keep useful outputs.

**Goal for this session**: Produce draft text for at least the first 2 major sections (~2000–3000 words raw output, edited down).

### Part 4: Review Progress & Tips (10 min)
- Invite 2–3 volunteers to share one paragraph they generated + how they edited it.
- Common issues & fixes:
  - Too generic → Add more specific prompts with source names.
  - Citation gaps → Always add manually from your reading.
  - Repetitive → Ask NotebookLM to vary sentence structure.
- Iteration tip: Re-upload your edited draft sections back into NotebookLM for continuity.

### Closing & Transition (5 min)
- Celebrate progress: “You now have the core pipeline to finish your chapter quickly and ethically.”
- Reminder: Save your notebook link and drafts.
- Preview Session 3: “After lunch, we’ll focus on strengthening academic quality – peer review style checks, referencing, and polishing.”
