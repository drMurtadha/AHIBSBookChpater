## 3) Key Content and Takeaways  

### Part 1 — Key Elements of Academic Quality  
**Core pillars of strong academic chapters**  
- Clear argumentation and logical progression.  
- Evidence-based claims and correct referencing.  
- Original contribution, through synthesis, insights, implications beyond prior work.  
- Coherence and readability, including transitions, consistent terms, and clear signposting.  
- Alignment with publisher requirements, especially originality, contribution, and structure criteria.

**Common weaknesses in AI-assisted drafts**  
- Generic phrasing and vague claims.  
- Weak transitions and repetitive section patterns.  
- Limited critical analysis and shallow comparison.  
- Missing citations or placeholder references.

**Goal today**  
Transform raw draft text into scholarly writing by using NotebookLM as a critical reviewer, then revising manually.

### Part 2 — Using NotebookLM for Critical Self-Review (Live Demo)  
**Step 1: Update your notebook with your draft**  
- Upload or paste your current draft sections from Session 2 as new sources.  
- Ensure your notebook contains guidelines, your research sources, and your evolving draft.

**Step 2: Use NotebookLM outputs for quality improvement**  
- Use chat to request focused critique.  
- Generate revision suggestions for specific sections.  
- Use structured outputs (briefing doc or study guide) to summarise strengths and weaknesses.

## 4) Copy-paste Prompts for Quality Enhancement  
Edit the bracketed items before use.

**Prompt 1 — Overall critique**  
```text
Act as an experienced academic peer reviewer. Review my uploaded draft sections against high-quality academic standards and the publisher guidelines I uploaded. Provide:
1) Strengths (2–3 points)
2) Major weaknesses (with specific examples from my text)
3) Suggested improvements for argumentation, originality, and flow
Do not rewrite the entire text. Focus on feedback.

**Prompt 1 – Overall critique**
   ```
   Act as an experienced academic peer reviewer. Review my uploaded draft sections against high-quality academic standards and UTM Press guidelines. Provide:
   1. Strengths (2–3 points)
   2. Major weaknesses (with specific examples)
   3. Suggested improvements for argumentation, originality, and flow.
   Do not rewrite the entire text — focus on feedback.
   ```

   **Prompt 2 – Strengthen argumentation**
   ```
   For the [specific section, e.g., Literature Review] in my draft, suggest ways to deepen critical analysis. Identify where claims are underdeveloped and propose 3–4 specific additions (e.g., counterarguments, comparisons, or implications) grounded in my uploaded research sources. Output as bullet-point recommendations with example sentences I can adapt.
   ```

   **Prompt 3 – Improve coherence and flow**
   ```
   Analyse transitions and logical flow in my draft. Suggest improved topic sentences and linking phrases for better coherence between paragraphs/sections. Provide revised versions of 4–5 weak transitions from my text.
   ```

   **Prompt 4 – Referencing and originality check**
   ```
   Review my draft for places needing citations. Suggest specific references from my uploaded research papers to support claims. Also flag any overly generic phrasing that reduces originality and suggest more precise, scholarly alternatives.
   ```

   **Prompt 5 – Generate enhanced version of a paragraph**
   ```
   Take this paragraph from my draft [paste paragraph]. Rewrite it to enhance academic depth, criticality, and voice while staying faithful to my original meaning. Use evidence from my sources and improve scholarly tone.
   ```

## 5) Hands-on Strengthening (What You Do Today)

Step-by-step
1.	Upload or re-upload your latest draft sections into NotebookLM.
2.	Run 3–5 targeted prompts on different sections or paragraphs.
3.	For each output:
- Read the feedback carefully.
- Revise manually in Word or Google Docs, rewrite extensively.
- Improve at least 2–3 sections.
4.	Track changes: note what NotebookLM suggested and what you implemented.

Target output for this session
- A revised draft with stronger argumentation, better flow, and improved referencing, roughly 1,000–2,000 words meaningfully improved.


## 6) Quick Shares and Transition

If invited, share:
- One “before” paragraph.
- The NotebookLM suggestion.
- Your “after” revision.

Common improvements to aim for:
- Deeper analysis, clearer contribution, stronger transitions, more precise language, better citation support.

Transition to next session:
- 	Move from strengthened content to publication-ready final editing and polish.
