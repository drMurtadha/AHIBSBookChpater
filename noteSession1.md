Participant Notes — Session 1: From Research to Chapter Plan

Time: 9:45 AM – 10:30 AM (45 minutes)
Outcome: Leave with a draft chapter plan, including a working title, abstract, and outline.

⸻

1) Session Objectives

By the end of this session, you should be able to:
	•	Explain the role and value of an edited book chapter in an academic career.
	•	Identify which of your existing research outputs or ideas can become a chapter.
	•	Produce a chapter plan, including a title, abstract, and detailed outline.
	•	Use AI tools effectively and ethically to accelerate planning.

3) Key Content and Takeaways

Part 1 — What Makes a Good Edited Book Chapter?

How it differs from a journal article
	•	Broader scope, more narrative freedom, more synthesis and interpretation.
	•	Can include conceptual framing, case studies, and future directions.
	•	Typical length: 6,000–10,000 words (always check the call guidelines).
	•	Audience may include academics, practitioners, and postgraduate students, so aim for accessible clarity.

Why it matters (Malaysian academic context)
	•	Can support publication evidence and institutional reporting (e.g., RADIS, MyRA, promotion).
	•	Often faster timeline than journals.
	•	Builds visibility and networks with editors and other contributors.

Common pitfalls
	•	Copying a journal article verbatim, duplication is usually rejected.
	•	Scope mismatch, too narrow and technical, or too broad and vague.

Part 2 — Selecting and Scoping Your Research

Inventory your research assets
	•	Published papers, conference papers, thesis chapters, datasets, ongoing projects.
	•	Literature reviews already written (grant proposals, dissertations).
	•	Ideas that were too big or out of scope for a journal paper.

Suitability checklist (quick self-test)
	•	Fits the book theme or call for chapters.
	•	Can be expanded with synthesis, new insights, or practical implications.
	•	Enough substance for 6,000+ words without padding.
	•	You can commit 2–3 months for writing and revision.

Examples (models you can copy)
	•	Conference paper on AI in education → expanded with case studies and policy recommendations.
	•	Grant-proposal literature review → refined into a state-of-the-art chapter.

Part 3 — Building the Chapter Plan

Your plan typically contains three deliverables:

A) Working Title
	•	Informative and specific.
	•	Example: Leveraging Large Language Models for Automated Code Review: Opportunities and Ethical Challenges
	•	Avoid vague titles like: Study on LLMs

B) Abstract (200–300 words)
Use this structure:
	•	Context
	•	Problem or gap
	•	Objective
	•	Approach or contribution
	•	Significance

C) Detailed Outline
	•	6–8 main sections, each with subsections.
	•	Add 1–2 sentence descriptions per subsection.
	•	Include approximate word count per section.

4) AI Demo Prompt (Template You Can Reuse)

Copy and adapt:

I have a published paper on [brief summary of my research area]. The edited book theme is [book theme]. Help me create:
(1) a compelling chapter title,
(2) a 250-word abstract, and
(3) a detailed outline with 6–8 main sections.
Ensure the chapter extends the original paper with new insights and practical implications.
Maintain full academic integrity, I will write all content myself.

Tip for better results: refine iteratively (tighten scope, specify audience, add 2–3 keywords, request a stronger contribution statement).

⸻

5) Hands-on Task (What You Produce Today)

Do this during the 8-minute activity:
	1.	Choose one research output or idea.
	2.	Write a 2–3 sentence summary of it.
	3.	Paste into an AI tool using the template prompt.
	4.	Generate and lightly edit:
	•	Title
	•	Abstract
	•	Outline
	5.	Save the output for later refinement.

⸻

6) Wrap-Up
	•	Volunteer share: title only (if asked).
	•	Reminder: AI accelerates ideation and structuring, but you remain the author and must ensure originality and integrity.
	•	Transition: next session will move from plan to drafting pipeline using LM notebooks.
